## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for building sleek, functional mobile and web applications. I thrive on debugging, problem-solving, and turning ideas into polished products. Whether it's configuring a Dart SDK or wiring up a backend with **Node.js + SQLite**, I learn by doing — and I build for impact.

Currently, I'm developing a job portal app with full authentication, admin panel, and persistent storage — designed to help students and recruiters connect better.
